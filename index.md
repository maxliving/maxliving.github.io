I am currently a data scientist at [Freebird](http://getfreebird.com), where I model flight cancellations, delays, and last-minute prices. Before that I was a data scientist at [Knewton](http://knewton.com), where I worked on proficiency models and recommendation systems for adaptive learning. My background is originally in economics -- I wrote my undergrad thesis about the effects of teacher unionization on school district spending and performance, and then worked at the New York Fed, where I primarily focused on education research.
