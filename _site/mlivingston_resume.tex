    {\bf Datadog} \\ 
    \null {\it Senior Data Scientist} \hspace{3pt} (May 2020 -- Present)
    \vspace{2pt}
  \begin{itemize} \itemsep 2.0pt \parskip 2.0pt %reduce space between items
  \item Embedded on security engineering team to explore problems that could be solved using ML models
    \setlength{\parskip}{-2pt} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength{\itemsep}{1.0pt}
    \item Developed, prototyped, and deployed (as a Spark batch ETL job) a novel anomaly detection system for monitoring Kubernetes audit logs
    \item Trained and deployed a random forest classifier to detect malware in internal DNS logs
    \end{itemize}
    \setlength{\parskip}{2.0pt} 
      
  \item Adapted an online outlier-detection model in Java to support multiple use-cases across a variety of Datadog products (APM, RUM, Logs)

    {\bf Freebird} \\ 
  \null {\it Director of Data Science} \hspace{3pt} (Jan 2020 -- March 2020) \\
  \null {\it Senior Data Scientist} \hspace{17pt} (Feb 2019 -- Jan 2020) \\
  \null {\it Data Scientist} \hspace{49pt} (Feb 2017 -- Feb 2019)
  \vspace{2pt}
  \begin{itemize} \itemsep 2.0pt \parskip 2.0pt %reduce space between items
    \item As the first Data Scientist at Freebird, was responsible for laying the mathematical framework for modeling the risk of a novel insurance-like product, factoring the problem into submodels to enable better error diagnosis and parallel iteration by the team, and determining the research agenda and priorities.
    \item Created automated risk reporting pipeline in Python to collect data from application database, generate predictions, and output forecasts into Looker for use by business teams
    \item Produced probabilistic loss forecasts to enable pricing of a \$5 million pilot with a major credit card issuer
    \item Trained scalable Bayesian models using MCMC and Variational Inference to predict the probability of flight cancellations, delays, and last-minute prices
    \setlength{\parskip}{-2pt} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength{\itemsep}{1.0pt}
    \item Presented research comparing methods for flight delay prediction at PAPIs conference 2018 (\href{https://www.infoq.com/presentations/flight-bayesian-prediction}{video})
    \item Built a Bayesian hierarchical model of cancellations that uses an auto-regressive process to capture intra- and inter-day correlations, allowing Freebird to forecast both attritional and catastrophic risk
    \end{itemize}
    \setlength{\parskip}{2.0pt} 
  \item Maintained Scala service to ingest real-time flight status updates from multiple third party sources so Freebird can notify travelers as soon as something happens to their flight
  \end{itemize}

  % \item Specific projects include 
  %   \setlength{\parskip}{-1.75pt} 
  %   \begin{itemize}
  %     \setlength{\itemsep}{1.5pt}
  \item Built new model to predict how long students spend on pieces of content using a Gaussian Mixture Model
    %\item Modeling the strength of concept pre-requisite relationships to produce better remediation strategies and provide insights into publisher content
  %\item Re-wrote a key component of the recommendation engine to simplify its logic and drastically improve its speed
    %\item Co-leading a weekly dashboard meeting of approximately 10 data scientists and engineers to better understand how our exisiting models are performing and track predictive accuracy metrics
